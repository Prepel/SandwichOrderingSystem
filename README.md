# SandwichOrderingSystem
A new, DDD-stylish, Sandwich Ordering System, mainly to learn about Domain Driven Design

To get started please create a settings.php file in the main directory, with the following settings:

```php
<?php

return [
    'db-host'     => '127.0.0.1',
    'db-user'     => 'user-name',
    'db-password' => '',
    'db-schema'   => 'schema-name'
];
```

In the folder SQL there is some setup SQL. This can be used to create a simple database structure that is used.
There is also some sample data included.
